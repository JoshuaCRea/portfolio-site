# Three-Card Poker

## Rules

Three-Card Poker is played between a player and the dealer.

Player must place Ante wager in order to receive cards. No other bets are required to start the round.

The Player can then choose to place one or both of the side bets, Pair Plus and Six-Card Bonus. The **Pair Plus** side bet is a wager that the Player's three-card hand will be a pair or better. Even if the player loses to the dealer, the Pair Plus bet wins if the player has a pair or better. However, if the player folds, the Pair Plus bet is forfeited. The **Six-Card Bonus** side bet is a wager that, if the Player's three-card hand and the Dealer's three-card hand were combined, those six cards would form a normal five-card poker hand, such as a 5-Card Flush, a Full House, or a 4 of a Kind. The Six-Card Bonus bet can still win if the player folds or loses to the dealer.

After the Player receives cards, they may look at their hand, and must choose to either "Play"-- and place an additional bet equal to their Ante-- or "Fold" and forfeit the Ante in order to avoid placing a Play bet.

If the player chooses to "Play," the dealer's hand is revealed and a showdown occurs. If the dealer has a Queen high or better the hand is said to ***qualify.*** The result of the hand is determined as follows with the rank of hands compared only if the dealer qualifies:

**Dealer does not qualify:** Ante bet pays out even money, Play bet is a push.
<br>**Dealer qualifies, Player's hand wins:** Ante bet pays out even money, Play bet pays out even money.
**Dealer qualifies, Player's hand ties:** Ante bet is a push, Play bet is a push.
**Dealer qualifies, Player's hand loses:** Ante bet is lost, Play bet is lost.

If the Player's hand consists of a *straight or better,* an **Ante Bonus** is paid on the Ante bet. This is not dependent on the dealer's hand or whether the player wins or loses. However, if the player folds, they will not receive this bonus.

The three-card hands are ranked as follows, from highest to lowest: *Straight Flush, Three of a Kind, Straight, Flush, Pair, High-Card.*

Exact payout amounts for each of the bonuses are presented on the table.

Good luck!
